# Machine Learning Driven Individualized Gait Rehabilitation: Gait Classification, Prediction, and Mechanism Design

End-to-End computational approach for individualized gait rehabilitation using machine learning techniques for gait classification, prediction, and specialized device design.

The initial component of our End-to-End approach is the Gait Classifier Module, which analyzes the current gait of the individual on which various further actions are dependent. Gait classification is carried out using K-nearest neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Network, and Random Forests to classify the gaits into healthy, Cerebellar Ataxia (CA), Hereditary Spastic Paraparesis (HSP), and Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). Leave one out and k-fold cross-validation methods are used to find out the performance of the models.
The following table gives the classification accuracies of the models with different cross-validations.

| Method  | LOO CV | 3-fold CV  | 5-fold CV | 7-fold CV | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| KNN  | 78.57%  | 71.04%  | 78.55%  | 78.99%  |
| SVM  | 88.23%  | 83.18%  | 86.55%  | 87.81%  |
| ANN  | 89.49%  | 83.58%  | 90.16%  | 88.65%  |
| RF   | 98.47%  | 93.60%  | 92.42%  | 95.79%  |
